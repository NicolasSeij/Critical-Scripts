# Trailers
Sick and tired of changing vehicles.meta files to make your beautiful trailers attach to your vehicles? Look no further! As long as your towing vehicle has the `attach_female` bone and the trailer has the `attach_male` bone setup properly, you should see a notification that you can attach the trailer as you get close to the hitch. If you are not using the auto attach option found in the config, the key to attach the vehicle is `G` or whatever your `INPUT_DETONATE` control is mapped to by default.
